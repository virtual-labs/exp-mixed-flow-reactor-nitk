<p style="text-align: justify;">Conduct simulation based experiments to determine the rate constant for the
saponification of ethyl acetate with NaOH at different temperatures using a mixed flow reactor(continuous stirred tank reactor). Also calculate the frequency factor and activation energy for the reaction. Discuss on temperature dependency of rate constant.
<center>CH<sub>3</sub>COOC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub> (A)+ NaOH (B)-> CH<sub>3</sub>COONa + C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH.</center>
It is an elementary reaction. Ethyl acetate is the limiting reactant</p>
