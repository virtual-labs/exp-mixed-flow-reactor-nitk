1. A liquid phase reaction is to be carried out in a suitable reactor. The stoichiometry of the reaction is A-> R. The feed concentration is 0.90 mol A/liter and is available at a rate of 100mol A/min. The following reactors may be considered for choice.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Mixed flow reactor</li>
<li>Tubular flow reactor</li>
<li>Recycle reactor with a recycle ratio of 0.50.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is desirable to achieve a fractional conversion of 0.778. Which one of the above
mentioned reactors do you recommend and why? The following data, available for the reaction, may be used in your calculations.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">2.  The liquid phase reaction A
-> R + S follows first
-
order kinetics with a reaction velocity
constant of 0.80 k sec<sup>-1</sup>. A feed having a concentration of 1 k mol A/m<sup>3</sup>
at a rate of 1.60 m<sup>3</sup>/k
sec. is available for processing.
A cascade having three equal sized back mix reactors, with
each vessel having a hold - up volume of 50 liters, is available for service. When this reaction is carried out in the cascade, find the final conversion which can be achieved.</p>
